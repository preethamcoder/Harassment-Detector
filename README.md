# Harrassment-Detector

This is an attempt to strictly moderate online speech and fight harassment. After testing across multiple servers and with friends and family of varied views, we concluded that most of the obfuscated speech has been flagged, better than most online models - including Instagram, TikTok, and Discord. 

# Steps To Use:
1. Git clone this repository by running ```git clone https://github.com/preethamcoder/Harassment-Detector.git```
2. Change into the directory by running ```cd Harassment-Detector```
3. Now, you will need to install the requirements by running ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
4. To obtain the model and datasets we used, you will need to request access at ```preetham23415@gmail.com```. We shall get back to you based on the order of emails received.
5. Once you have the model downloaded, simply run ```python3 app.py``` and open your localhost to experience this.
